# Calculator made with Tkinter
Basic calculator made for practice with python and to learn a bit of TKinter

![preview picture](preview.png "Preview picture")

For now it contains just basic functions like:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplying
- division
- percentage calculation

I might add more in the future

Even tho it does not contain that much functions, it still had some coding to do.

## Main features:
- Input checking (for example: only one 0 at front of the fraction, or only one dot per number, and more)
- Replacing last sign if we hit sign again
- If there is sign as last input and '.' will be clicked, it will add 0 before dot
- Correct order of operations
- For percentage: replace last number with calculated number: if last operation is adding, or subtracting, it will calculate whole input and insert right number instead percentage; if last operation is multiplying or dividing it will divide last number by 100
